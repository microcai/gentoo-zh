		Tauri is a polyglot and generic system that is very composable and allows
		engineers to make a wide variety of applications. It is used for
		building applications for Desktop Computers using a combination
		of Rust tools and HTML rendered in a Webview. Apps built with Tauri
		can ship with any number of pieces of an optional JS API / Rust API so that
		webviews can control the system via message passing. In fact, developers can
		extend the default API with their own functionality and bridge the Webview
		and Rust-based backend easily.
