		An unidentifiable mechanism that helps you bypass GFW.
		Trojan features multiple protocols over TLS to avoid both
		active/passive detections and ISP QoS limitations.
		Trojan is not a fixed program or protocol. It's an idea,
		an idea that imitating the most common service, to an extent
		that it behaves identically, could help you get across the
		Great FireWall permanently, without being identified ever.
		We are the GreatER Fire; we ship Trojan Horses.
