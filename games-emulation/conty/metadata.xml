This is an easy to use compressed unprivileged Linux container packed into a single executable. It is designed to be as simple and user-friendly as possible. You can use it to run any applications, including games (Vulkan and OpenGL).

Includes, among others, these apps: Wine-GE, Steam, Lutris, PlayOnLinux, GameHub, Minigalaxy, Legendary, Bottles, MultiMC, MangoHud, Gamescope, RetroArch, Sunshine.

Based on Arch Linux.

All applications that you run with Conty read and store their configs in your HOME directory as if you weren't using the container at all.

No performance overhead. Since it's just a container, there is virtually no performance overhead, all applications will run at full speed. Regarding memory usage, Conty uses a bit more memory due to compression and because applications from the container can't share libraries with your system apps.

Supports Xorg, Wayland and XWayland.

Supports Chaotic-AUR and ALHP repositories. AUR is also supported.

With Conty you can play Windows games on no-multilib profile.
