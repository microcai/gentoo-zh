3. GRANT OF RIGHTS
3.1. The Product is provided to Customer on a ‘per user’ basis, where Customer must assign a Subscription to a specific User who may deploy the Product on multiple Machines in accordance with the Product documentation. If the Product is accessed via a Floating License Server (as described in Section 5.3), the Product is provided to Customer on a ‘per machine’ basis, where the Floating License Server allocates the Subscription to a specific Machine that can only be used by one User at a time. If Customer complies with the terms of this Agreement, JetBrains grants to Customer the rights set out in this Section 3 to the extent necessary to enable Customer and their Users to effectively use the Product. All other rights remain reserved by JetBrains.
3.2. Unless the Subscription has expired or this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 12, and subject to the terms and conditions specified in this Agreement, JetBrains grants Customer the non-exclusive and non-transferable right to use each Product covered by the Subscription as stipulated below:
(A) Customer may:
(i) install and use any version of the Product covered by the Subscription on any operating system supported by the Product; and
(ii) make one copy of the Product solely for archival, security, and/or backup purposes.
(B) Customer may not:
(i) allow the same Subscription to be used concurrently by more than one (1) User, unless the Product is provided via a Floating License Server as specified in Section 5.3.(C);
(ii) rent, lease, reproduce, modify, adapt, create derivative works of, distribute, sell, or transfer the Product;
(iii) provide a third party with access to the Product or Customer’s JetBrains Account, or the right to use the Product;
(iv) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify, translate, or make any attempt to discover the source code of, the Product; or
(v) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Product.
3.3. Following the expiration of this Agreement, the rights stipulated in Section 3.2(A) shall continue on a perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive, and non-transferable basis for the continued use of a Fallback Version of each Product covered by the Subscription. The limitations set forth in Sections 3.1 and 3.2(B) of this Agreement apply to the usage of the Fallback Version, as does Section 12.5. The rights granted in this Section 3.3 are expressly contingent upon Customer not being in breach of this Agreement, including having paid the applicable Subscription fees for the preceding 12 months in full and without interruption.
3.4. Customer acknowledges that no ownership rights are conveyed to Customer under this Agreement, irrespective of the use of terms such as ‘purchase’ or ‘sale’. JetBrains has and retains all rights, title, and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Products, any and all related or underlying technology, and any modifications or derivative works of the Products, including without limitation as they may incorporate Feedback (as defined below).
3.5. If an independent module of the Product or the Product as a whole is a Redistributable Product, the following provisions shall apply in addition to Sections 3.2-3.4, unless specified otherwise in the terms relating to the use of the particular Redistributable Product:

(i) use the Redistributable Product without the quantitative restrictions set out in Sections 3.1 and 3.2(B)(i);
(ii) transfer, reproduce, redistribute, and provide access to the Redistributable Product to a third party;
(iii) sell your product containing or using the Redistributable Product to a third party, but not the Redistributable Product on its own;
(iv) redistribute the Redistributable Product onto another Machine for legitimate purposes in accordance with this Agreement and applicable law, and use the Redistributable Product on that Machine, provided that you have received authorization from the owner of that Machine to deploy and use the Redistributable Product in this way. You will indemnify JetBrains against any losses, costs, or damages arising from your deployment of the Redistributable Product onto another Machine in violation of this Section.
(B) You agree that any Redistributable Product you reproduce, redistribute, or provide a third party access to must be governed by an agreement concluded between the relevant third party as a Customer and JetBrains, and that the third party must be bound by that agreement prior to the use of the reproduced or redistributed Redistributable Product. JetBrains is the exclusive owner and licensor of the Redistributable Product. You acknowledge that you are liable to JetBrains for any loss or damages in connection with any breach of this Section.
4. PURCHASING THROUGH RESELLERS AND DISTRIBUTORS
This Agreement applies whether Customer purchases a Subscription directly from JetBrains or through an authorized JetBrains reseller or distributor. If Customer purchases through a JetBrains reseller or distributor, the Subscription details shall be as stated in the Subscription Confirmation issued by the reseller or distributor to Customer, and the reseller or distributor is responsible for the accuracy of any such Subscription Confirmation. Neither resellers nor distributors are authorized to make any promises or commitments on JetBrains’ behalf, and Customer understands and agrees that JetBrains is not bound by any obligations to Customer other than as specified in this Agreement.
5. ACCESS TO PRODUCTS
5.1. All deliveries under this Agreement will be electronic. Customer and their Users must have an Internet connection in order to access their JetBrains Account and receive any deliveries.

5.3. Customer may enable Users to activate and access Products in one of the following ways:
(A) JetBrains Account – by sending an invitation from Customer’s JBA to a User’s JBA. Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Product will periodically connect from the User’s Machine to JetBrains’ servers via the internet to confirm the User’s right to use the Product;
(B) Activation code – by generating an offline activation code in Customer’s JBA and providing it to a User for offline Product activation. Customer must generate a new activation code and apply it to the Product registration interface when prompted;
(C) License server – via an application provided by JetBrains through a ‘floating license server’ that enables Customer to access the Product on a ‘per machine’ basis (“Floating License Server”). The Floating License Server is an option that is provided at the sole discretion of JetBrains upon written request and may be subject to separate terms and conditions.
6. FEES

Customer may not deduct any amounts from fees payable to JetBrains or an authorized JetBrains reseller, unless otherwise specified in the applicable terms of purchase.
7. FEEDBACK
Customer has no obligation to provide us with ideas, suggestions, or proposals (“Feedback”). However, if Customer or Users submit Feedback to us, then Customer grants us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license that is sub-licensable and transferable, to make, use, sell, have made, offer to sell, import, reproduce, publicly display, distribute, modify, or publicly perform the Feedback in any manner without any obligation, royalty, or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise.

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Customer is granted a one-time right to install and use each major version of a Product for evaluation purposes, without charge, for a period of thirty (30) days (or such other period as may be specified in the official Product documentation) from the date of Product installation (“Evaluation Period”). Customer’s use of the Product during the Evaluation Period shall be limited to internal evaluation and testing of the Product for the sole purpose of determining whether the Product meets Customer’s requirements and whether Customer wishes to continue using the Product.
9.2. Customer may end the Evaluation Period at Customer’s sole discretion any time. Upon the expiration of the Evaluation Period, Customer’s right to continue using the Product will terminate, unless Customer purchases a Subscription to the Product.

16. GENERAL
16.1. Entire Agreement. The following documents are part of (‘incorporated into’) this Agreement: the JetBrains Privacy Policy, available at https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/privacy/privacy.html, the Data Processing Addendum (if applicable) at https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/dpa, and the JetBrains Terms and Conditions of Purchase, available at https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/store/terms. Together, these documents form the entire agreement and replace any previous agreement between you and us in relation to its subject matter. Except as expressly mentioned, this Agreement does not apply or give rights to anyone else (‘no third-party beneficiaries’). No purchase order, Customer terms, or other document that purports to modify or supplement this Agreement will vary the terms of this Agreement unless signed by Customer and JetBrains.
16.2. EAP Version. Customer may choose to use EAP Versions during a Subscription period. Such use is subject to the JetBrains EAP User Agreement (available at https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/toolbox/user_eap.html), and by using the EAP Version Customer accepts these terms and conditions. If Customer ceases to use an EAP Version but continues to use Product, such use will continue to be governed by this Agreement. Your use of an EAP Version does not entitle you to any Subscription refund and does not relieve you of your payment obligations under this Agreement.
16.3. Reservation of Rights. JetBrains reserves the right at any time to cease its support of the Product and to alter prices, features, specifications, capabilities, functions, terms of use, release dates, general availability, and other characteristics of the Product. Nothing in this Agreement limits any rights a consumer may have under applicable consumer protection laws.
16.4. Changes to this Agreement. The Agreement can be updated from time to time to reflect changes in the Product and how it is offered to you.
(A) If this happens, we will update the terms on the JetBrains website and let you know either:
(i) by displaying them to you in the Product;
(ii) in your JetBrains Account; or
(iii) by sending the updated version to the email address used in your JetBrains Account.
(B) Any updated Agreement will start (‘be effective’) on the date specified in the updated Agreement. By continuing to use the Product after the effective date, you agree to be bound by the modified Agreement.
(C) We respect that you may not agree to the updated Agreement. If that is the case, you can terminate your Subscription any time up to 30 days after the effective date of the updated Agreement. Termination according to this Section entitles you to a pro-rata refund of the pre-paid unused Subscription fees.
(D) If you are using a Fallback Version and object to the update to the Agreement, you can continue using the Fallback Version under the previously applicable terms.
16.5. Opportunity to Review. Customer declares that it has had sufficient opportunity to review this Agreement, understand the content of all of its sections, negotiate its terms, and seek independent professional legal advice before entering into it. Consequently, any statutory “form contract” (“adhesion contract”) regulations shall not be applicable to this Agreement.
16.6. Severability. If a particular term of this Agreement is not enforceable, the unenforceability of that term will not affect any other terms of this Agreement.
16.7. Interpretation. Headings and titles are for convenience only and do not affect the interpretation of this Agreement. Terms such as “including” are not exhaustive.
16.8. No Waiver. Our failure to enforce or exercise any part of this Agreement is not a waiver of that section.
16.9. Notice. JetBrains may deliver any notice to Customer via electronic mail to an email address provided by Customer, or via Customer’s JetBrains Account, registered mail, personal delivery, or reputable express courier (such as DHL, FedEx, or UPS). Any such notice will be deemed to be effective (i) on the day the notice is sent to Customer via email, (ii) upon being uploaded to Customer’s JetBrains Account (irrespective of when Customer actually receives it), (iii) upon personal delivery, (iv) one (1) day after deposit with an express courier, or (v) five (5) days after deposit in the mail, whichever occurs first.
16.10. Governing Law. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the Czech Republic, without reference to conflict of laws principles and specifically excluding the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. The Parties to the agreement constituted by this Agreement undertake to use best commercial efforts to amicably settle any disputes arising hereunder (“Dispute”).
16.11. Dispute Resolution. Should the Parties to this Agreement fail to settle a Dispute amicably, the Dispute will be excluded from the jurisdiction of general courts and the Dispute will be finally decided by the Arbitration Court attached to the Czech Chamber of Commerce and the Agricultural Chamber of the Czech Republic, by three arbitrators in accordance with the Rules of that Arbitration Court, and the language of the proceedings will be English; if you are a consumer, we both agree that any Dispute-related litigation may only be brought in, and shall be subject to the jurisdiction of, any competent court of the Czech Republic, unless provided otherwise by applicable consumer law. Consumer Disputes can also be settled out of court through the Czech Trade Inspection Authority (www.coi.cz) or the European Commission’s online platform for dispute resolution (http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr).
16.12. Data Privacy. By accepting this Agreement, Customer acknowledges that JetBrains will process personal data in accordance with JetBrains’ Privacy Policy (available at https://www.jetbrains.com/company/privacy.html). Unless you have signed an individual data processing addendum with JetBrains, the JetBrains data processing addendum available at https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/dpa applies.
16.13. Force Majeure. Neither Party shall be in breach of this Agreement, or otherwise liable to the other, by reason of any delay in performance, or non-performance, of any of its obligations under this Agreement (except payment obligations), arising directly from an act of God, fire, flood, natural disaster, act of terrorism, strike, lock-out, labor dispute, public health emergency, civil commotion, riot, or act of war.
