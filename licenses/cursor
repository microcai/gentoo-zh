9.	Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver
9.1	Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law governing this Agreement, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement in Section 9.2 below and preempts all state laws (and laws of other jurisdictions) to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in San Francisco, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration Agreement below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that San Francisco, California is the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the Arbitration Agreement below is found to be unenforceable.
9.2	Arbitration. READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM CURSOR. This Section 9.2 (this “Arbitration Agreement”) applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and us that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (a) this Agreement, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof; (b) access to or use of the Software, including receipt of any advertising, marketing, or other communications from us; (c) any transactions through, by, or using the Software; or (d) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with us, directly or indirectly, as a user or consumer (“Claim” or collectively, “Claims”). This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your consent to this Agreement.
If you are a new user, you can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement within thirty (30) days of accepting this Agreement by emailing Cursor at [legal@cursor.sh] with your full legal name and stating your intent to opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect the binding nature of any other part of this Agreement, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought.
For any Claim, you agree to first contact Cursor at [legal@cursor.sh] and to attempt to resolve the Claim with Cursor informally. In the unlikely event that we have not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) calendar days, each of us agree to resolve any Claim through binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS (the “Rules”), except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com, where the Rules are available. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall control. The arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. county where you live or San Francisco, California unless you and we agree otherwise. If you are using the Software for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Software for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and we agree that the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether this Agreement, or any provision of this Agreement, is unconscionable or illusory or any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.
Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed as: preventing Cursor from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of its data security, intellectual property rights, or other proprietary rights; or preventing you from asserting claims in small claims court, provided that your claims qualify, and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances on only an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.
If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will have no impact on the remaining provisions of this Arbitration Agreement, which will remain in force, or on the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining Claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver below is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement will be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.
9.3	Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver. REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF USER YOU ARE, INCLUDING WHETHER YOU ARE A NATURAL PERSON OR AN ENTITY, ANY CLAIM MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS SECTION 9.3 (THIS “CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER”) APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. EACH PARTY AGREES THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER USERS. EACH PARTY FURTHER AGREES THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY IS WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER.

10.5	Entire Agreement/Severability. This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Cursor in connection with the Software, will constitute the entire agreement between you and Cursor concerning the Software. Except as otherwise stated in the Arbitration Agreement, if any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which will remain in full force and effect.
10.6	No Waiver. No waiver of any term of this Agreement will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or of any other term, and Cursor’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
