TSL is not free software. For several reasons I have not placed it␍
under any conventional open source license. I might do so in the␍
future, but for now the following shall apply:␍
␍
The source code is provided so you can compile it on any architecture␍
and verify what runs inside your computer.␍
␍
You may distribute unmodified copies of the source package.␍
␍
I don't really mind unofficial patches or ports, but I prefer if you␍
contact me first.␍
␍
You are not allowed to sell TSL in any form (source code or binaries).␍
␍
TSL comes with no warranty. Use it at your own risk.␍
␍
Some parts of the program are licensed under other conditions:␍
␍
