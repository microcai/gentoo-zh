	This is an implementation of double-array structure for representing trie, 
	as proposed by Junichi Aoe.
	Trie is a kind of digital search tree, an efficient indexing method in which
	search time is independent of database size. It only takes O(m) search time,
	where m is the length of the search string. Comparably as efficient as hashing,
	trie also provides flexibility on incremental matching and key spelling
	manipulation. This makes it ideal for lexical analyzers, as well as spelling
	dictionaries.
