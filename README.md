#package review:

	*)	I trust contributors that have commit right, therefor commitors
		should think carfully befor commit.

	*)	If you want to discuss your commit/patch, push to *another branch*
		and discuss in the mail list or with the maintainer.

	*)	Every ebuild change should not produce compile error before commit

	*)	Every ebuild should be tested in every ARCH that it KEYWORDS for.
		if not, don't claim that you support that keyword.
