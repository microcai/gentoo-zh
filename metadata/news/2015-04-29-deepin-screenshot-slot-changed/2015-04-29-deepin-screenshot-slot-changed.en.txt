Since the deepin-screenshot v3(depends on PyQt5) is very different to v2, the SLOT of 
media-gfx/deepin-screenshot has changed to :2 and :3, and no more slot :0 survived. 
If you have installed the old media-gfx/deepin-screenshot, you may reinstall it:
  
  emerge -1 media-gfx/deepin-screenshot:2
  
or you can try the new version:
  
  emerge -1 media-gfx/deepin-screenshot:3
